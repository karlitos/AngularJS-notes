## Q/A

* Round-Trip Web-Application
  * __A:__ Round-trip apps are apps that change pages on every get/post/put request. The round trip is the path the application takes from the browser, to the server, to the browser to display every change in state to the user.
* where to put the `<script>` tags - head/body ?
* where/how to link local resources/remote (CDN) resources ?
* JavaScript closures
* what is the __perent scope_ of an __isolated scope__ defined in a directive

## AngularJS

### Scopes

* Collection of variables and functions defined in specific context (accessible in one moment / place)
* There is always one root-scope
* scope inheritance - scope B can inherit from scope A and thus all the variables and functions from A are accessible in B
* variables and functions of the parent scope can be overridden in the child scope
* you can still access parents variables and functions of the pare scope, but only indirectly __ HOW ?? __
* it is possible to define _isolated scopes_ - mostly applied in _directive definitions_ where the accessibility of variables and functions can be precisely defined
* allows creating enclosed, reusable components, prevents collisions/overriding of variables

### Inversion control - Dependency injection
* defining the dependencies with parameters, the resolution and initialization happens to the runtime and is done by the framework/environment
* the opposite of the _dependency injection_ is _hard-coding_ of the dependencies in the code

### Building blocks

#### Modules

* most coarse-grained Angular structure
* encapsulates a collection of common, related components
* container for:
  * Controller
  * Services
  * Directives
  * Filter
* aggregation meaningful done by module-responsibility/assignment _e.g. user-management_

#### Controller
* the business-logic of the _scopes_ for a certain view
* controller should be kept _simple_, complex logic should be encapsulated in _Services_
* controller should not _manipulate DOM_, this should be done in _directives_

#### Models
* plain JavaScript data types
* 2-way data binding work only, when models are defined in _scopes_

`````` javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp');

app.controller('MyCtrl', function($scope) {
  $scope.user = {// simple JS Object
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 27,
    email: 'john@doe.com'
  };

  $scope.phones = [ ...] // array
});
``````

#### Routes
* _deep linking_  use of a hyperlink that links to a specific, generally searchable or indexed, piece of web content on a website
* linking between the URL and related _controller/template_

`````` javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp');

app.config(function($routeProvider) {
  $routeProvider
    .when('/', {
      templateUrl: './templates/mainTemplate.html'
      controller: 'MainCtrl'
    })
    .when('/user', {
      templateUrl: './templates/userTemplate.html'
      controller: 'UserCtrl'
    })
    .otherwise({redirectTo: '/'
  });
});
``````

#### Templates/Views
* _templates_ contain _HTML_, _directives_ and _expressions_ which will be interpreted by the browser
* _views_ are instantiated _templates_

#### Expressions
* access to the data defined in a particular _scope_
* the _{{ }}_ thing
* if the result of the evaluation is _null_ or _undefined_ there is no output
* you can not use _loops_ or _control structures_ (if/else)
* you can use additional _filter_

#### Services
* thin controller, fat service
* each service will has at most one instance -> _singleton pattern_
* there are 5 ways to define a service
  * __Provider__ - general service definition API, has to contain a __$get()__ function which returns the instance of the service
  * __Factory__ - build on top of the __Provider__ without broad configuration possibilities
  * __constructor__ service(...) - allows to register an object of an already declared Class as a Service
  * __value as a service__ value(...) - allows to register a value as a Service, the value can be primitive data-type, Object or a function
  * __constant as a service__ constant(...) - allows to register a constant value as a Service, which value cannot be changed during the runtime

##### Provider configuration

``````javascript
angular.module('myApp').provider('logger', function(){
  // private
  var prefix = '';

  //  logger implementation
  var log = function(level, message){
    console.log(prefix + '[' + level + ']' + message);
  };
  // public configuration method
  this.setPrefix = function(newPrefix){
    prefix = newPrefix;
  }

  this.$get = function(){
    return {
      error: function(message){
        log('ERROR', message)
      },
      debug: function(message){
        log('DEBUG', message)
      }
    }
  };
});

...
//confoguration
angular.module('myApp').config(function(loggerProvider){
  loggerProvider.setPrefix('|=> ... ')
});

...
// dependency injection
angular.module('myApp').controller('myCtrl', function(logger){
  logger.debug('Some debugging message');
});
``````
* The _config()_ method will be called with the __specified service name__ (e.g. 'logger') together with the 'Provider' suffix => _loggerProvider_

#### Directives
* allow creating of new, re-usable components/HTML elements
* directives are created with the __directive('someName', function(){...})__ method with two parameters:
  * name of the directive
  * so called factory function
* naming convention:
  * declaration: _camelCase_ (opacityAndColorPicker)
  * in HTML: _snake-case_ (opacity-and-color-picker)
* the 'factory function' has to return either an function - _postLink -Function_ or an _directive-definition-object (DDO)_

##### postLink-Function
* it gets at least 3 parameters:
  * scope - reference to the scope valid for this directive
  * element - reference to the DOM element this directive affects
  * attrs - reference to the object allowing us to access the HTML-attributes of the DOM elements
* when returning only the _postLink -Function_ all directive properties will have the default values

``````javascript
var directiveDefinitionObject = {
   priority: 0,
   template: '<div></div>', // or // function(tElement, tAttrs) { ... },
   // or templateUrl: 'directive.html', // or // function(tElement, tAttrs) { ... },
   transclude: false,
   restrict: 'A',
   templateNamespace: 'html',
   scope: false,
   controller: function($scope, $element, $attrs, $transclude, otherInjectables) { ... },
   controllerAs: 'stringIdentifier',
   bindToController: false,
   require: 'siblingDirectiveName', // or // ['^parentDirectiveName', '?optionalDirectiveName', '?^optionalParent'],
   compile: function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) {
     return {
       pre: function preLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... },
       post: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... }
     }
     // or // return function postLink( ... ) { ... }
   },
   // or // link: {
   //  pre: function preLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... },
   //  post: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... }
   // }
   // or // link: function postLink( ... ) { ... }
 };
``````
* this means that the directive could be applied as a property of a '<div>' element by default
> __Best Practice:__ It's recommended to use the "directive definition object" form.

##### directive-definition-object (DDO)
* an Object with attributes defining the directive
  * __restrict__ - defines the area of validity/applicability of the directive
    * E - Element name (default): ``<my-directive></my-directive>``
    * A - Attribute (__default__): ``<div my-directive="exp"></div>``
    * C - Class: ``<div class="my-directive: exp;"></div>``
    * M - Comment: ``<!-- directive: my-directive exp -->``
  * __template__ - for short 1-2 lines long template description
  * __templateUrl__ - linkage to more complex descriptions
  * the templates are HTML markup that may:
    * eplace the contents of the directive's element (default).
    * Wrap the contents of the directive's element (if transclude is true)
  * __scope__ - the scope of the directive, can be true, an object or a falsy value
    * __falsy__: No scope will be created, parent's scope will be used
    * __true__: A new child scope that prototypically inherits from its parent will be created
    * __{...}__ (an object hash): A new "isolate" scope is created for the directive's element.
    * Following explanation is borrowed from the [AngularJs wiki](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes):

    ...directives often need access to a few parent scope properties. The object hash is used to set up two-way binding (using '=') or one-way binding (using '@') between the parent scope and the isolate scope. There is also '&' to bind to parent scope expressions. So, these all create local scope properties that are derived from the parent scope. Note that attributes are used to help set up the binding -- you can't just reference parent scope property names in the object hash, you have to use an attribute. E.g., this won't work if you want to bind to parent property `parentProp` in the isolated scope: `<div my-directive>` and `scope: { localProp: '@parentProp' }`. An attribute must be used to specify each parent property that the directive wants to bind to: `<div my-directive the-Parent-Prop=parentProp>` and `scope: { localProp: '@theParentProp' }`.

     ...use `attrs.$observe('attr_name', function(value) { ... })` in the linking function to get the interpolated value of isolate scope properties that use the '@' notation.  E.g., if we have this in the linking function -- `attrs.$observe('interpolated', function(value) { ... })` -- `value` would be set to 11.  (`scope.interpolatedProp` is undefined in the linking function.  In contrast, `scope.twowayBindingProp` is defined in the linking function, since it uses the '=' notation.)

## JS

###  Self-Invoking Functions
* A self-invoking expression is invoked (started) automatically, without being called.
* Function expressions will execute automatically if the expression is followed by ().
`````` javascript
(function () {
    var x = "Hello!!";      // I will invoke myself
})();
``````

### JavaScript Closures
* A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

`````` javascript
var add = (function () {
    var counter = 0;
    return function () {return counter += 1;}
})();

add();
add();
add(); // the counter is now 3
``````
* _add_ is assigned the return value of a self-invoking function
* _add_ becomes a function =>  _return_ returns a function expression
*  it can access the counter in the parent scope.
